==Features==

* Scripting system using the simple but powerful Lua language. Use server-side and client-side scripts to create anything from a spawn menu to entire gamemodes.
* Server browser allows you to easily find a server and keep track of your favorites.
* Steam integration
** Join-on-friend and integration with the steam server list.
** Servers can track and ban players by Steam ID; if a server has a password-based login system, they're doing it wrong.
* An optimised network streamer means a server can support thousands of players and vehicles across Panau.
