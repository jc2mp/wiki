{{Lua/Function |
  prototype = BaseWindow:SetBackgroundVisible(boolean) |
}}

==Description==

Sets whether the background is visible. It is set to true by default. This only applies to a few types; for most types, it is useless.

The following types are affected:
* [[Lua/Client/Button|Button]] - Removes the button part, so it looks like a [[Lua/Client/LabelClickable|LabelClickable]]
* [[Lua/Client/ComboBox|ComboBox]]
* [[Lua/Client/TextBox|TextBox]]
* [[Lua/Client/TextBoxMultiline|TextBoxMultiline]]
* [[Lua/Client/Tree|Tree]]
