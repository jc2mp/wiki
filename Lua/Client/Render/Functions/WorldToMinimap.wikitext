==Additional Notes==
*The minimap radius is 512m.
*The boolean is '''true''' if the position is within the visible minimap and '''false''' if it would be outside of the minimap.
*The position is always clamped to the radius of the map, meaning this function will never return a position that is not on the minimap.
