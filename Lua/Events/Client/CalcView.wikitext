{{Lua/Event|
  return = Return false to disable the local player.
}}

==Description==

This event is the only place you should change the camera position and rotation. It is ran every frame.

If false is returned, your character will become disabled; that is, invisible and unable to move. Your character will still be visible to others, however. This is useful if you want to have some sort of spectate mode.

==Examples==

====Rotate the camera around a nice view of Panau====

<syntaxhighlight>
Foo = function()
	local angle = Angle(os.clock() * 0.2, -0.2, 0)
	Camera:SetAngle(angle)
	local position = angle * Vector3(0, 0, 16384)
	Camera:SetPosition(position)
	
	return false
end

Events:Subscribe("CalcView", Foo)
</syntaxhighlight>

====First-person mode====

<syntaxhighlight>
Foo = function()
	Camera:SetPosition(LocalPlayer:GetBonePosition("ragdoll_Head"))
	
	return true
end

Events:Subscribe("CalcView", Foo)
