{{Lua/Event|
  arguments = string character
}}

==Description==

Fired when a character is pressed. Basically, ''character'' is what would be output to the chat or text box. Arrow keys, function keys, etc aren't fired. shift+key works, so you can detect the ! key, for example. If a character is held down, it repeats.

==Examples==

<syntaxhighlight>
Foo = function(args)
	Chat:Print("You pressed the "..args.character.." key" , Color(255, 255, 255))
end

Events:Subscribe("CharPress", Foo)
</syntaxhighlight>
