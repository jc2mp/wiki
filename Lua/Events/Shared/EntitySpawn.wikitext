{{Lua/Event |
  arguments = object {{Arg|entity}}
}}

==Description==

{{Arg|entity}} can be one of:
* Player
* Vehicle
* Checkpoint
* StaticObject
* ClientStaticObject
* ClientEffect
* ClientSound

To get the type, use ''args.entity.__type''.

Vehicles count as spawned when they automatically respawn.

On the client, when objects are streamed in, they fire the event as well, not just when they are created.

==Example==

<syntaxhighlight>
function Foo(args)
	print("A "..args.entity.__type.." just spawned.")
end

Events:Subscribe("EntitySpawn", Foo)
</syntaxhighlight>
