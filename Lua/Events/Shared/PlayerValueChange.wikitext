{{Lua/Event |
  arguments = [[Lua/Server/Player|Player]] {{Arg|player}}, string {{Arg|key}}, object {{Arg|value}}
}}

==Description==

Fired when a player's value changes. Player values are persistent across modules, but not between server/client.

The event is fired when Player:SetValue is called from any module. It is '''not''' fired by calling [[Lua/Server/Player/Functions/SetNetworkValue|Player:SetNetworkValue]].

==Example==

====Client====

Use '/set key value' and '/get key' to play around with it.

<syntaxhighlight>

function Foo(args)
	Chat:Print(
		tostring(args.player).."'s "..args.key.." was set to "..tostring(args.value),
		Color.Yellow
	)
end

Events:Subscribe("PlayerValueChange", Foo)

function LocalPlayerChat(args)
	local words = args.text:split(" ")
	
	if words[1] == "/set" and #words == 3 then
		LocalPlayer:SetValue(words[2], words[3])
	elseif words[1] == "/get" and #words == 2 then
		local value = LocalPlayer:GetValue(words[2])
		Chat:Print(
			words[2].." is currently set to "..tostring(value),
			Color.Yellow
		)
	end
end

Events:Subscribe("LocalPlayerChat", LocalPlayerChat)
</syntaxhighlight>

==Additional notes==

* If you set a key to the value it's already set to, the event will still fire.
