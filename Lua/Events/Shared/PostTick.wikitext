{{Lua/Event}}

==Description==

Fired after JC2-MP game/server logic is run.

====Server====

The rate varies depending on server load and network. When the network usage is idle, it will aim for a maximum of 100 ticks per second to save CPU. When the network becomes more saturated, the server will run it as fast as it can.

====Client====

This is ran once every frame.

==Examples==

====Print the tickrate once per second====

<syntaxhighlight>
timer = Timer()
numTicks = 0

function Foo(args)
	numTicks = numTicks + 1
	if timer:GetSeconds() > 1 then
		print(numTicks.." ticks per second")
		timer:Restart()
		numTicks = 0
	end
end

Events:Subscribe("PreTick", Foo)
