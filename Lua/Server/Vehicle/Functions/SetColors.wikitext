function PlayerChat(e)
	if e.text == "/random" and e.player:InVehicle() then
		-- Generate a color for the vehicle, using a hue from 0 to 360,
		-- and a random saturation and value from 0.5 to 0.7
		local color = Color.FromHSV( 
			math.random( 0, 360 ), 
			math.random() * 0.2 + 0.5, 
			math.random() * 0.2 + 0.5 )
		e.player:GetVehicle():SetColors( color, color )
	end
end

==Additional Notes==
*Each color corresponds to a different tone
*Vehicles in Just Cause 2 use a two-tone system for colors which can be used to emulate effects such as pearlescent coating.
