==In depth description==

Many types, such as tables and the JC2-MP API classes, are copied by reference (''a = b''). This function allows you to copy by value instead. A common use is performing a deep-copy on a large table.

Any type that can be marshalled can be used. That is, anything that [[Lua/Shared/Network/Functions/Send|Network:Send]] and [[Lua/Shared/Events/Functions/Fire|Events:Fire]] can pass along will work. Numbers, Vectors, tables, and so on. See [[Lua/Tutorials/Reference/Marshallable_Types|here]] for the list. Copying Players or Worlds or the like will not actually copy them; this function is not very useful for those types.

==Motivation==

If you have a Color ''color1'' and you want to copy it into ''color2'', simply doing ''color2 = color1'' will make ''color2'' a reference to ''color1''. If you do ''color2.r = 123'', it will change color1, too, which may not be what you want.

You could manually recreate the Color, but it is annoying:

<syntaxhighlight>
color1 = Color(255, 0, 0, 128)
color2 = Color(color1.r, color1.g, color1.b, color1.a)
</syntaxhighlight>

This is where Copy comes in:

<syntaxhighlight>
color1 = Color(255, 0, 0, 128)
color2 = Copy(color1)
</syntaxhighlight>
