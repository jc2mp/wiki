==Server and client==
{{Lua/Function |
  returns = boolean |
  prototype = IsValid(object {{Arg|object}}) |
  description = Returns true if {{Arg|object}} exists.
}}


==Client only==
{{Lua/Function |
  returns = boolean |
  prototype = IsValid(object {{Arg|object}}, boolean) |
  description = Returns true if {{Arg|object}} exists. The boolean is whether to check if the object is also streamed in (near the local player). Default is true.
}}

==Description==

A common use of this function is to make sure Player references are still around. For instance, if you store a Player somewhere and they disconnect, you still have that Player variable. If you try to call functions on it, you will get a null reference error. You can use IsValid to determine if your Player variable is still good or not.

==Examples==
Simple test to see if the default world is valid.
<syntaxhighlight>
print(IsValid(DefaultWorld))
--> true
</syntaxhighlight>

==Additional Notes==
* Works for all types.
* Returns false if the argument is nil.
* Types that can become invalid references:
** Player
** Vehicle
** Checkpoint
** World
** StaticObject
** GWEN classes
