IMHO the second example is wrong and the error is reported when I use the example on server with one player only. GetId() will return 0 for the first player on server which will turn the playerlist table into non-sequential - Lua requires sequential table to start with [1]. The result is that randomvalue will not work at all on servers with a single player and it will ALWAYS skip the first player on servers with more players. Solution can be to use table.insert instead. However as I am Lua newbie (learning for few weeks only, can someone validate first?
<syntaxhighlight>
local playerlist = {}
for player in Server:GetPlayers() do
	table.insert( playerlist, player )
end
return table.randomvalue(playerlist)
</syntaxhighlight>
