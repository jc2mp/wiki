Client-side scripts work very similarly to server scripts. The server automatically sends clients scripts when they join, and also when a module is reloaded. But other than that, the only difference is the classes and functions available. Clients cannot spawn vehicles or set their own health, for example; server scripts must do that.

==Render event==

An important feature of client-side scripts is the ability to render text, images, and primitives. The Render and PostRender events are where you should call [[Lua/Client/Render|drawing functions]]. They will not work anywhere else.

====Draw a red dot in the center of the screen====

<syntaxhighlight>
function Foo()
	Render:FillCircle(Render.Size / 2, 5, Color(255, 0, 0))
end

Events:Subscribe("Render", Foo)
</syntaxhighlight>

This is the most simple example. The Render:FillCircle function takes a [[Lua/Shared/Vector2|Vector2]] for screen position in pixels, a number for the circle radius, and a color. Render.Size is a Vector2 that is the size of the screen in pixels. If we divide that by two, we get the center of the screen. The radius is also in pixels.
