There are two suggested ways to allow Lua modules to interact: firing events and SQL databases.

==Using Events==

[[Lua/Shared/BaseEventManager/Functions/Subscribe|Events:Subscribe]] and [[Lua/Shared/Events/Functions/Fire|Events:Fire]] work between modules. Using them is simple: Module A uses ''Events:Subscribe'' as normal, but, instead of subscribing to one of the event names the API provides, use your own name. When Module B uses ''Events:Fire'' with the same event name, Module A receives it.

=====Module A=====
<syntaxhighlight>
Events:Subscribe("Banana", MyFunction)
</syntaxhighlight>

=====Module B=====
<syntaxhighlight>
Events:Fire("Banana")
</syntaxhighlight>
