Some of the functions in the API use iterator functions. These must be used with for statements.

As an example, if you want to use [[Lua/Server/Server/Functions/GetPlayers|Server:GetPlayers]], use the following syntax:

<syntaxhighlight>
for player in Server:GetPlayers() do
	print(player)
end
</syntaxhighlight>
