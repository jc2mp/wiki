__NOTOC__

Weather severity values go from '''0''' to '''2'''. '''0''' is clear weather with no low-altitude clouds. '''2''' is the maximum weather possible.

It is region-dependent; it will never snow in desert areas.

Panau's weather is stubborn and will often not do what you tell it to. You can set the weather severity to 2 and it may refuse to rain for a few minutes, even in a rain forest. Then suddenly it will start pouring. Sometimes it starts raining with a value of 0.5.
