==Server hosts==

This page will list hosts that you can use for JC2-MP hosting. Please note this is merely a list, we do not vouch for any of these hosts.

====How to add a host====

Simply login into this wiki by using the "Click here to login with your JC2-MP account" link at the right top and edit this page. If you offer both gameservers and VPSes / Dedicated servers, you can add your host to both tables. Please do not remove any hosts you do not know, open a forum topic to do this instead. Hosts need to at least have a website and fixed pricing to be listed here. Using any referral URLs is not allowed unless it goes to JC2-MP to cover our server costs. '''The server hosts are sorted by alphabetical order, so add your host at the correct place in the table. Please use preview to make sure it looks properly before saving.'''

==Gameserver hosts==
The hosts listed here offer gameserver hosting, which means they manage the servers and run the JC2-MP server for you. This means you do not have to worry about the servers, networking, firewalls, updates and generally get access to a control panel that allows you to easily manage your JC2-MP server. Please note that the features listed previously are usually the case but not guaranteed, contact a host if you want to make sure about certain features you need.

==VPS / Dedicated server hosts==
The hosts listed here offer VPSes and/or dedicated servers, which are unmanaged machines that need to be configured, updated and maintained by you using SSH/RDP. They do not come with a control panel and it's entirely up to you to install the JC2-MP server and requirements. Please note that the features listed previously are usually the case but not guaranteed, contact a host if you want to make sure about certain features you need.
