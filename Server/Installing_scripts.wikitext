Scripts should be installed to ''scripts/''. They are automatically loaded on server startup. You can reload a script using the ''reload'' console command, such as ''reload nametags''.

If you are installing a script named AwesomeScript, the resulting directory structure should look similar to the following:

* JcmpServer/
** scripts/
*** AwesomeScript/
**** server/
***** SomeLuaFile.lua
**** client/
**** shared/


The ''server/'', ''client/'', and ''shared/'' directories may contain .lua files, but none are required; nametags only uses the ''client'' directory, for instance.

The server may come with a ''default_scripts'' directory, which contains some useful and common scripts, such as nametags. You can also find updated scripts on the official GitHub page [https://github.com/jc2mp/]. You will need to either rename the ''default_scripts/'' directory or copy the contents into the ''scripts/'' directory.
