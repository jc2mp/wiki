==Resource usage==

A server requires very little resources, a $5 VPS from [https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c053cdfd84c5 Digital Ocean] can easily run a few hundred players.
The main bottlenecks are usually (in order): bandwidth, CPU, uplink, memory and diskspace. For more hosts, please check out our [[Server/Hosts|Server Hosts]] page.

===Bandwidth and network usage===
While this greatly depends on scripts and sync rates, generally 100 players will use 5 mbit up and 1 mbit down.
This means a server with 100 players consistently throughout the entire month uses 2 TB of bandwidth.

===CPU Usage===
This again greatly depends on scripts and sync rates, a server with a few light scripts will use about 10% of an i5 CPU at 3.10 GHz.
Most servers however will be running huge scripts so it entirely depends on the scripts and their optimisation.

===Memory and disk usage===
This entirely depends upon your scripts and log file. The server without any scripts or log file uses around 30 MB of disk space and 40 MB of RAM.

==Beta tests==
We ran the final beta test on a dedicated server with the following specifications:
* Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570S CPU
* 4 cores at 3.10 GHz
* 8 GB of RAM
* 2x 1 TB at 7200 rpm in software RAID 1
* 100 mbit full-duplex

Please note that most of this was not necessary, on average the server used:
* 1-2 full cores
* 400 MB of memory
* 250 MB of disk space
* 50 mbit up, 10 mbit down
